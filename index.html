    <h1 class="underline">Introduction to HTML</h1>
    <p>
      HTML (<span class="underline">H</span>yper<span class="underline">T</span>ext <span class="underline">M</span>arkup <span class="underline">L</span>anguage) is the code that is used to structure a
      web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within
      a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data
      tables.

      As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of
      HTML and its functions.

  <h2 class="underline">So what is HTML?</h2>
  <p>
    HTML is a <strong>markup language</strong> that defines the structure of your content. HTML
    consists of a series of <em>elements</em>, which you use to enclose, or
    a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to
    somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller,
    and so on. For example, take the following line of content:
  </p>

  alt="Anatomy of an html element"
  width="500"/>

  <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
  <ol>
      <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
      <li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
      <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
      <li><strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>HTML is a markup language used to describe structure and content of a webpage, it says what content should be on a webpage. An HTML document is made up of a series of elements. Some of these elements are...</p>
  <ul>
      <li>heading tag</li>
      <li>paragraph</li>
      <li>list tags</li>
      <li>image</li>
      <li>hyper references (link)</li>
  </ul>
